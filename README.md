# Thomson-scattering
## Relativistic high-intensity laser electron scattering

This project simulates the scattering of high energy photons from non-linear Thomson scattering. The interaction of a free and highly relativsitic electron beam with a realistic 3-dimensional laser field is simulated. In the code the user is provided with alternatives of using the paraxial approximation for calculating fields in the laser beam or calculate laser field parameters with accuracy as high as the 5th order non-paraxial correction term.
