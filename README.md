# Thomson-scattering
## Relativistic high-intensity laser electron scattering

THIS PROGRAM SIMULATES THE SCATTERING OF HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS FROM  NON-LINEAR THOMSON SCATTERING: THE INTERACTION OF A FREE AND HIGHLY  RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON WITH A REALISTIC 3-DIMENSONAL LASER FIELD. THE LASER FIELD CAN BE CALCULATED PARAXIALLY BY SETTING eps = 0 or non-paraxially upto 5th non-paraxial order.
